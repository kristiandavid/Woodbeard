    <p class="lead">Hello there. I am Woodbeard, an amateur woodworker from Canada.</p>
    <p>I work mainly with hand tools and I mostly make wooden bookholders which I've named Holdens...cause they're 'holden' your book open. Get it?!</p>
    <p>I'll be adding more items as I go along and suck less at the art of woodworking, but in the meantime enjoy a selection of Instagram photos below!</p>

    <h2>Talk to Woodbeard</h2>
    <p>Go ahead! This site uses voice recognition to determine when you're speaking. Just start off by saying "Hey Woodbeard..." then say your question/comment/rant/etc.</p>
    <p>I promise this is totally true and I will absolutley get your message and you won't look at all silly talking to a website.</p>
    <p>Ok, hopefully you didn't actually try that. If you'd like to contact me, you can reach me on my facebook page linked below, or send me an email to ibuildthings@iamwoodbeard.com</p>
